# I2C

[← Command reference](README.md) · [Project README](../README.md)

## `bus <scl> <sda>`

Initializes an I2C bus for use by future commands, specified by the `scl` and `sda` pins.

## `scan`

Scans the I2C bus enumerates the found devices in a table with the hexadecimal least significant digits along each column and the most significant digits as rows.  If a device is not found, the intersection should be left blank.  If one is found, print the address in hex at the intersection.

If any errors are present that prevent the bus from being properly scanned, such as missing pull up resistors, print the state of the bus that prevents scanning.

## `read <address> <bytes=1>`

Reads the specified number of bytes from the specified address on the bus.  If the number of bytes are not specified, one byte is read.

## INA237

Reached as `i2c ina237 ...`, or by entering the `i2c` menu and then `ina237`.
Drives TI INA237 current/voltage/power monitors, which occupy addresses
`0x40`–`0x4f` depending on how their A0/A1 pins are strapped. Several can be
present on one bus, each with its own shunt resistor.

The shunt input range is left at the device default of ±163.84 mV. Combined
with the shunt resistance this fixes the current resolution: at the default
0.004 Ω the device reads ±40.96 A at 1.25 mA per count.

### `config <address> [shunt_ohms]`

Registers a monitor and programs its calibration. The shunt resistance defaults
to **0.004 Ω**. Before accepting the device, `MANUFACTURER_ID` is read and must
report `0x5449`, so a wrong address or a different chip is reported rather than
silently producing plausible-looking numbers. Re-running on the same address
updates it in place.

Note that `MANUFACTURER_ID` is the only identification available: unlike the
INA238 and INA228, the INA237 has no `DEVICE_ID` register, so this check
confirms a TI part of this family but cannot distinguish the exact variant.

### `read [address]`

Reads the measurement registers and reports bus voltage, current and power,
along with shunt voltage and die temperature. With no address, every configured
monitor is read. With an address that has not been configured, the monitor is
registered on the spot using the default shunt.

The `DIAG_ALRT` register is checked on every read: an arithmetic overflow
(`MATHOF`) or a trim-memory checksum error (`MEMSTAT`) is reported, because
either one means the reported values cannot be trusted. `SHUNT_CAL` is also
read back, so a device that has reset since it was configured is flagged
instead of reporting mis-scaled current.

### `list`

Shows the configured monitors with their shunt resistance, current resolution
and full-scale range.

## SHT4x

Reached as `i2c sht4x ...`. Drives Sensirion SHT4x humidity and temperature
sensors. The address is fixed by the part variant — `0x44` for the A variant
(such as the SHT40-AD1B), `0x45` for B and `0x46` for C — so every command takes
an optional address that defaults to **0x44**.

Unlike the INA237 the SHT4x has no registers. A command byte is written, the
sensor is given time to measure, and the result is read back in a separate
transaction; reading too early makes the sensor NACK. Each 16-bit value carries
its own CRC-8, which is checked on every read, so corrupted data is reported
rather than converted into a plausible-looking measurement.

### `read [address] [high|medium|low]`

Measures temperature and relative humidity, reporting both in engineering units
along with the raw tick values. Repeatability defaults to `high`; lower settings
are faster and noisier. Humidity is cropped to the physical 0–100 %RH range, and
if cropping was necessary the uncropped value is shown too — during bringup a
wildly out-of-range reading is a signal, not noise.

### `serial [address]`

Reads the sensor's 32-bit serial number. The SHT4x has no ID register, so a
serial number that reads back with valid CRCs is the available evidence that a
real sensor is responding.

### `heater [address] <mW> <ms>`

Pulses the on-die heater and then reports the measurement the sensor takes just
before switching it off. Power is 20, 110 or 200 mW and duration is 100 or
1000 ms; only those six combinations exist in the device. Useful for driving off
condensation, and for confirming the part responds to a stimulus.

### `reset [address]`

Issues a soft reset.

## NAU7802

Reached as `i2c nau7802 ...`. Drives a Nuvoton NAU7802 24-bit bridge ADC as a
load cell front end. The address `0x2a` is fixed in silicon — there are no
address pins, so only one can be present per bus.

The normal bringup sequence is:

```
i2c nau7802 init            # power up, self-calibrate
i2c nau7802 gain 128        # typical for a load cell's few mV of output
i2c nau7802 tare            # with the scale empty
i2c nau7802 calibrate 100   # with a known 100-unit mass on it
i2c nau7802 weight          # thereafter, in those units
```

### `init [ldo <volts>]`

Resets the device, powers up the digital then analog sections, waits for the
power-up ready flag, and runs the internal offset calibration.

By default AVDD is taken from the pin, which is the chip's own default.
Boards that rely on the internal regulator — many load cell breakouts do —
need `init ldo 3.0`. This is not the default deliberately: enabling the
internal regulator on a board that already drives AVDD would put two sources on
one net.

### `gain [1..128]` and `rate [10|20|40|80|320]`

Show or set the PGA gain and conversion rate. Both re-run the internal offset
calibration afterwards, because either change alters the analog path and
invalidates the existing calibration — without that, readings come back
swinging across most of the full-scale range.

**320 SPS is not usable on the board this was developed against.** It returns
values spanning the entire range regardless of calibration, while 10–80 SPS are
rock steady; the likely cause is that 320 SPS needs an external crystal rather
than the internal RC oscillator. The command warns when you select it.

### `read [samples]`, `tare [samples]`, `calibrate <known mass> [samples]`, `weight [samples]`

`read` reports the averaged raw count, the spread across the samples, and the
percentage of full scale. An absolute voltage is deliberately not reported: it
would depend on REFP−REFN, which this driver has no way to know.

`tare` captures the zero offset, `calibrate` derives the scale factor from a
known mass, and `weight` reports the load in whatever unit was used to
calibrate. `weight` also reports the sample spread converted into those units,
so every reading carries an indication of its own noise.

Two guards worth knowing about. Any reading pinned at full scale is reported as
a saturation error rather than a large number — during bringup that usually
means the bridge is disconnected, unexcited or miswired. And `calibrate`
refuses when the reading has not moved clear of the noise, since calibrating
against noise yields an absurd scale factor that silently corrupts every later
weight.
